# The QMIND Github Hub

The purpose of this repository is to hold any useful documents relating to Github. These documents will help keep teams stay organized and work effectively on technical projects.

## Templates

This repository includes templates for [Pull Requests](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and [Issues](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md). When placed in a `.github` folder in the root of another repository, they will provide a template for any issues or pull requests open in the future. This is useful as it provides consistency when tracking the history and evolution of a project, and ensures that important information is kept track of. It is recommended that you include these templates in any collaborative projects. Feel free to make any revisions to make them more relevant for the specific project in which they are included.

# Assignment

Included in this repo is an [optional assignment](./ASSIGNMENT.md) for becoming more familiar with the Git workflow. This process encapsulates the whole workflow, giving you the opportunity to create a local repository and `push` it to GitHub. We will be using these tools a lot this year so be sure to give it a look, even if you already feel confident with your Git skills. Happy hacking!
